    <h2>What is a callsign?</h2>
    <p>
        In this case, <em>callsign</em> refer to an amateur radio callsigns.
        This tool is designed for ham radio operators.
        Callsigns are (to large extent) composed of
    <ul>
        <li>a Latin prefix representing the country</li>
        <li>an Arabic number</li>
        <li>and a Latin suffix</li>
    </ul>
    The meaning of each part differs across countries and is irrelevant here.
    </p>
    <h2>What is analyzed?</h2>
    <p>
        The callsign is measured and classified using various metrics.
        These metrics are indicators that can hint at practical aspects, such as ease of spelling and ease of remembering.
    </p>
    <h2>How is it done?</h2>
    <p>
        We apply techniques from the field of natural language processing (NLP).
        The callsign is not analyzed based on syntax alone.
        Rather, it is translated into a phonetic transcription.
        This allows us to provide pronunciation-related information as well.
    </p>
    <h2>Why was is done?</h2>
    <p>
        Callsigns can be a means of self-expression or of delivering a message, but they can also have negative side effects, both practically and socially.

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Good</th>
            <th>Suboptimal</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>DO8BIT<br/>(reference to 8-bit computing)</td>
            <td>K1QRP<br/>(contains operating signal)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    *Disclaimer: I did not intend to address any specific individuals in the displayed example call signs, which may be issued.
    The metrics used here are highly subjective, though the calculations are objective.
    <p>
        This tool is designed to help you choose a callsign wisely.
        For those interested, it provides a quick report that makes iterating ideas much easier and more systematic.
