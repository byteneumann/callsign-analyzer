    <h2>What is a callsign?</h2>
    <p>
        Here, <em>callsign</em> refers to an amateur radio callsigns.
        This tool is designed for ham radio operators.
        Callsigns are (to large extent) formed according to the following structure:
        <table>
            <trh>
                <th>Format</th><th>Quantity</th><th>Part</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Arabic number</td><td>at the beginning or not at all</td><td>country prefix</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Latin letter(s)</td><td>at least one</td><td>country prefix</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Arabic number</td><td>one except for special callsigns</td><td>number</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Latin letter(s)</td><td>mostly two or three letters</td><td>suffix</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    The meaning of each part differs across countries and is irrelevant here.
    </p>
    <h2>What is being analyzed?</h2>
    <p>
        The callsign is measured and classified using various metrics.
        These metrics are indicators that can hint at practical aspects, such as ease of spelling and ease of
        remembering.
    </p>
    <h2>How is it done?</h2>
    <p>
        We apply techniques from the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
        The callsign is not analyzed based on syntax alone.
        Rather, it is translated into a phonetic transcription.
        This allows us to provide pronunciation-related information as well.
    </p>
    <h2>Why was is done?</h2>
    <p>
        Callsigns can be a means of self-expression or of delivering a message, but they can also have negative side
        effects, both practically and socially.

            The metrics used here are highly subjective, though the calculations are objective.
